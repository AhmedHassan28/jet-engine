        <h2>Brief jet engine</h2>
        <p>
            jet engine, any of a class of internal-combustion engines that propel aircraft by means of the rearward
            discharge of a jet of fluid, usually hot exhaust gases generated by burning fuel with air drawn in from the
            atmosphere, The prime mover of virtually all jet engines is a gas turbine. Variously called the core, gas
            producer, gasifier, or gas generator, the gas turbine converts the energy derived from the combustion of a
            liquid hydrocarbon fuel to mechanical energy in the form of a high-pressure, high-temperature airstream.
            This energy is then harnessed by what is termed the propulsor (e.g., airplane propeller and helicopter
            rotor) to generate a thrust with which to propel the aircraft.

        <h2>Principles of operation</h2>
        <p>
            The gas turbine operates on the Brayton cycle in which the working fluid is a continuous flow of air
            ingested into the engine’s inlet. The air is first compressed by a turbocompressor to a pressure ratio of
            typically 10 to 40 times the pressure of the inlet airstream (as shown in Figure 1). It then flows into a
            combustion chamber, where a steady stream of the hydrocarbon fuel, in the form of liquid spray droplets and
            vapour or both, is introduced and burned at approximately constant pressure. This gives rise to a continuous
            stream of high-pressure combustion products whose average temperature is typically from 980 to 1,540 °C or
            higher. This stream of gases flows through a turbine, which is linked by a torque shaft to the compressor
            and which extracts energy from the gas stream to drive the compressor. Because heat has been added to the
            working fluid at high pressure, the gas stream that exits from the gas generator after having been expanded
            through the turbine contains a considerable amount of surplus energy—i.e., gas horsepower—by virtue of its
            high pressure, high temperature, and high velocity, which may be harnessed for propulsion purposes
